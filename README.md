# Cookiecutter Template for Fields of Mistria Mod with YYTK Framework

A [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template that comes with the following content

- Aurie Framework @ `e3a6e994e425cc581bce48643b3c375be1ca2adb`
- YYToolkit @ `86c133dc7f4e87991dd2cb7f2eac056dc5f13124`
- A packaging script for MOMI (`package.ps1`)

## Usage

Install [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (it comes with `uv`) and then run

```
uvx cookiecutter gh:jumpyapple/cookiecutter-fom-yytk-mod
```

Alternatively you can follow [installation instructions by Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and then
replace `uvx` with `pipx run`.

## Why don't you use VS's template?

I cannot find a way to include files in the solution folder.
